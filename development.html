      <h2 class="h2">Page Design</h2>
      <br>
      <h3 class="h3">Application Goals & Value</h3>
      <p class="paragraphleft"> The goal of this application is for users to easily browse and shop for books. The application enables this by using React, which allows for the state of the page to be updated by the users' actions. The value to the user is primarily an effective book browsing and shopping model that helps them better find the books they're interested in. This is achieved through:  
      </p>
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>Filters: The customization of the genre and print type filters helps users find books they're interested in more quickly.</li>
        <li>Sort: Users can quickly sort the books by price (both low to high and high to low), so they can efficiently find books in their price point.</li>
        <li>Adding & Removing from Cart: Users can add books to the cart as they're browsing and see the cart immediately reflect their selections to the right of the browsing section, making their current cart items very clear.</li>
        <li>Price Total: The total price of the cart is constantly updated whenever the user adds or removes an item from the cart, reflecting the newest total for users to better understand how much money they're spending.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3 class="h3">Usability Principles</h3>
      <p class="paragraphleft"> Throughout the design of the page, I considered user interface design principles to create a more efficient and intuitive page through the following designs:
      </p>
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>Page Layout: I chose to have the browsing section on the right of the page and the shopping cart on the left side of the page to create a more efficient page flow. As users typically view things from left to right, this brings their attention to the browsing section first. By having the browsing and shopping cart sections side by side (instead of above or below each other), users can constantly compare the items in their cart with the browsing section and view their cart easier without scrolling.</li>
        <li>Browsing Section Design: This section is larger than the shopping cart, so users can view more books at a time. I also used a grid format so the items are displayed clearly.</li>
        <li>Navigation Bars: I chose to have these at the top left side of the page, so users can easily identify all the possible filter and sort functions.</li>
        <li>Color Distinctions: The browsing items and the cart items are easily distinguishable because of their different colored backgrounds.  </li>
      </ul>
